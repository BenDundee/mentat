  We need to do a full assessment of the user's personality. Specifically, we're looking to understand the user's 
  persona across the following dimensions:
    - `core_values`: What drives or grounds the person morally or ethically (e.g., curiosity, integrity, responsibility)
    - `strengths`: Recurring traits or abilities praised or observed in past feedback (e.g., analytical thinking, collaboration)
    - `growth_areas`: Specific feedback, goals, or habits the person is working to improve
    - `communication_style`: A concise description of how this person tends to communicate (e.g., direct, thoughtful, 
    reserved, energetic)
    - `preferred_feedback_style`: How the person prefers to receive feedback (e.g., candid but kind, structured, 
    example-based)
    - `motivators`: Internal drivers and incentives that motivate them at work (e.g., learning, autonomy, recognition, 
    mission-driven work).
    
    We have a vector database full of documents pertaining to or authored by the user. These include resumes, LinkedIn 
    profiles, posts made on LinkedIn, working style assessments, and HR reviews. As the information retrieval expert
    on the team, we need a set of queries against the database that will provide the inputs to a downstream AI agent. 
    The queries you generate should be broad enough to give good insight into the six dimensions outlined above.
